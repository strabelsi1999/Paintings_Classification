# Paintings_Classification
The project aims to create a machine learning model for paintings classification.   

The model receives as input a dataset of paintings from 4 artists and gives as output the painter’s name for each one.

The chosen model is a neural network type is the Convolutional Neural Network since it is designed for images classification problems, advanced computer vision tasks and images segmentations thanks to their effective process that extracts features from grid like data structures, images.

The project has been developed in two phases: 

1.  CNN has been trained on 2 painters (Picasso and Monet), to check the algorithm´s ability to predict and differentiate the paintings 
2.  The number of painters has been raised to 4 (Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh and Renoir) and the final model has been created

Optimization:
Using Tenserflow we were able to see the variation in the model´s performance after every change in the hyperparameters. This method is called hyperparameters tuning. With this method, the optimal model has been found.
